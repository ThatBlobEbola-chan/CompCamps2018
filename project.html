    <p class="center text">In CompCamps this year, a currency was created via inspiration from the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and three loot crates would be offered to those who compiled the most. This currency was dubbed CC Coin for obvious reasons, and the campers quickly started accumulating it via the mining software. The quest was on to accumulate the most.My quest to get as much holla' dolla' as possible began with simply opening as many windows of the software as possible and then copying it to upload on my computer at home so I could produce more. From here however, I simply took opportunity when I discovered it. It started with my good PAL Javin, who really wanted a Monster energy drink. I wanted money. He wanted drink. SO I DECIDED TO DO THE ONLY LOGICAL THING SOMEONE COULD DO, MAKE THE</p>

    <p class="center text">In exchange for buying Javin his energy drink during bowling, he would give me ALL the CC Coins he got. But it didn't stop there. The next day I accidentally bought a bag of Welchers Fruit Gummies. You know yo' boy don't play with no Welchers, so instead of eating them anyway, I decided to sell them for CC Coins. The taker gave me a WHOPPING total of-- 10 coins. But then since I had so much money and they had just about none, the dude gave me the rest of his coins, and another camper, Ryan, (Javin couldn't remember his name at all,) gave me all his coins.</p>

    <p class="center text">It was announced after this that an auction would be held for Loot Crate #2. I had the most money in the camp with 182 at this point, which translated into 44$CAD thanks to the standard introduced via the gummy purchase earlier. With 40 of those dollars I successfully bid my way to the 2nd Loot Crate. It took two days to reach my balance once more, even combatting corporate espionage in the case of a couple young hooligans who wrote a script on a USB that literally just stole my information for the 'bank account' once inserted. The bank fined the guy that transfered stuff using my account though, and I just made a new bank ID which I'm keeping on a USB myself, getting the money from my old account in via my CC Coin Minion Javin. In conclusion on how to make money: I don't really know to be honest I probably just got lucky.</p>
